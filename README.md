# Noot-Runner-v1
 Noot Runner™ 🐧 – Duck, jump, and collect in the ultimate winter crypto game!  🔋: Powered by  ✳️AbstractChain  &  🐧nootonabstract  | 🎮Dev:  Recoverrr

 My very first game coded and designed 100% by ChatGPT & Myself for @nootonabstract's vibe coding hackathon powered by AbstractChain!

 In this game your purpose is to maneuver, be it by Jumping or Ducking, the obstacles to collect Abstract coins and last as long as you can to land your name on the community leaderboard. 
 Plus you can use the same Abstract coins PLUS $NOOT to purchase/unlock in game character skins.

Can you unlock them all?

The game also includes a 'Gift Carousel', head in there every 6 hours for your chance at some juicy in game rewards!

NootRunner v1 comes with both Desktop (Primary) UI as well as a Mobile (Secondary) UI for players to play. As of now NootRunner will give you the best user expierence on the Desktop version. Mobile version will finish up development after the hackathon ends: 4/27/25

Mobile is playable and includes most features, but a lot of fine tuning is still needed. Again desktop view reccommended.


*REQUIREMENTS*
-------------------
1.) MetaMask Wallet
